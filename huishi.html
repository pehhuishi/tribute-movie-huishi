  <p>The Emoji Movie is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated science
    fiction-comedy film directed by Tony Leondis and written by Leondis,
    Eric Siegel and Mike White, based on the emoji symbols.</p>

  <p>Hidden inside a smartphone, the bustling city of Textopolis is home
    to all emojis. Each emoji has only one facial expression, except for
    Gene, an exuberant emoji with multiple expressions. Determined to become
    "normal" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his best friend
    Hi-5 and a notorious code breaker called Jailbreak. During their travels
    through the other apps, the three emojis discover a great danger that could
    threaten their phone's very existence.</p>
